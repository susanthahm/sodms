Mr.Cooper is selling some products online, but not through an ecommerce website, by advertising on social media and taking orders by phone. His sales hotline number is routed among 3-5 of his sales persons. Currently orders taking by sales persons send order details through WhatsApp and each order is then entered to an Excel sheet manually. Then he manage separate Excel sheets for delivery, returns and payment informations. He only accepts Cash on Delivery (COD) and Bank Transfers as payment modes. The current manul process is time consuming, difficult to follow-up orders and handle inquiries. Therefore he wanted to develope a simple online system to handle this order management process.

This system is created to address these issues and manage online order taking and processing. This is a simple system created using PHP in Boostrap and JQuery.

Operation:

He creates other users and enter products to the system. Sales persons can only add order details to the system and the delivery persons can view pending delivery orders and after delivering an order, he has to update it as completed delivery. Once sales persons add new orders to the system Mr.Cooper edit these new orders and update orders with delivery date and assign orders to different delivery persons. If return an order, Mr.Cooper update order and mark the order as Returned and take neccessary actions to reshedule the order.

Orders are highlighted in different colors to easily identify the status of the order. Order summary page has an filter to search orders based on date range, product and users.
